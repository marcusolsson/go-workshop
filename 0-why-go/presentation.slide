Go Fundamentals
Why Go?

* What is Go?

Go is a modern, general-purpose programming language.

- Compiled
- Statically typed  
- Garbage collected
- Concurrent
- Simple
- Productive

* What is Go?

Go is object-oriented but:

- no classes
- no subclassing
- implicit interfaces

Simple pieces connected by small interfaces

* History

- Project started in 2007 by Griesemer, Pike and Thompson, at Google
- Open sourced in 2009
- Version 1.0 was released in 2012

* Designed to scale

Designed by and for people who read and write large software systems

Designed to be able to scale to:

- large code bases
- large teams
- large number of dependencies

* Designed to be modern

Should be:

- suitable for multicore machines
- suitable for networked machines
- suitable for the web

* Designed to be productive

* go tool

The go tool is the standard tool for building, testing, and installing Go programs

To compile and run `hello.go`:

    $ go run hello.go

Run all tests in the current directory:

    $ go test

To fetch, build and install a package:

    $ go get github.com/sirupsen/logrus

* Workspaces 

No build scripts are needed

The go tool accomplishes this by requring a predefined directory structure

    go/
      bin # executable binaries
      pkg # compiled object files
      src # source code

The current workspace is set using the `GOPATH` environment variable.

Since Go 1.8, the `GOPATH` is by default set to:

- Linux/Mac: `$HOME/go`
- Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\go`

* gofmt

Automatic code formatting was intended from the beginning

Eliminates fruitless discussion about style

Each code base feels familiar

"Gofmt's style is no one's favorite, yet gofmt is everyone's favorite." - Go proverb

* Godoc

Godoc extracts documentation from your Go code

.link https://godoc.org/fmt https://godoc.org

Documentation that lives with code is easy to keep up-to-date.

* Go is boring

Go's purpose is _not_ research into programming language design

Optimized for reading rather than writing for code

Designed to only use tried and tested features and focus on developer productivity

Your favorite language feature is most likely not in Go

* This workshop

Intended to give you a head start

After today you will have learned

- basic workflow
- basic language syntax
- common idioms
